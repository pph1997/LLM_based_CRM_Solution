## 🚀 Project Summary  
This project presents a **web-based proof-of-concept** to automate CRM data entry from **voice notes** recorded by field sales reps.  

Using:
- **Whisper** (OpenAI) for speech-to-text transcription  
- **DeepSeek API** for structured data extraction via LLM  
- **SQLite** for CRM simulation  
- **Flask + HTML** for a minimal web frontend  

The solution enables reps to upload voice recordings, confirm extracted CRM fields, and directly save them into a database—**reducing manual input and improving data quality**.
